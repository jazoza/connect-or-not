equipment:

  * laptop, running Pd-extended (preferably under a Linux OS)
  * arduino + DMX shield (http://www.tinkerkit.com/dmx-master-shield/ *using a 3pin version with KK4 equipment)
  * wifi router (TP LINK WR703N router with OpenWRT driver)
  * eurolite DMX lights (http://www.recordcase.de/cosmoshop/pix/a/media/0020105380/sls-400.pdf) 
  * clubscan scanners http://www.robe.cz/fileadmin/robe/downloads/user_manuals/User_manual_ClubScan_250_CT.pdf)
  * android phone(s) running the connectornot application (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.lmag.connectornot)


software:

  * pd-extended (http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended)
  * arduino IDE (version 1.0.5 for older boards; version 1.5.6-r2 BETA for Leonardno, Yun, Due)
  * DmxSimple library (a copy is to be found in this repository; for older boards use DmxSimple31; for Leonardo and newer use DmxSimpleLeonardo)
  * OpenWRT driver (http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin)
    --> instructions here: http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Install_OpenWRT_on_TPlink_WR703N ; AP configuration file in the repository (wireless-AP-mode) use to overwrite /etc/config/wireless on the router
  * pd patch (k4-setup.pd) found in this repository


HOW TO

  - Install all the necessary software;
  - Make sure you have correct versions of Arduino IDE and DmxSimple library for your Arduino; in case you are using different DMX shield or different lights, get the corresponding library and/or check channel configuration;
  - Upload the SerialToDmx.pde code to your board (found in DmxSimple*/examples/SerialToDmx/);
  - Connect your wifi router to an ethernet connection and make sure it's in the AP mode, and that it is online;
  - Connect all devices to the network that's set up on you router (e.g. ConnectOrNot)
  - Start pd-extended, open k4-setup.pd patch
  - In the patch, choose the correct port (click the message "devices" connected to comport object, in the pd control window look for your device in the list of available serial ports; under Linux it is usually 0 or 1 when more devices are connected; under windows it is often 64); if necessary, edit the message "open 0" to correct the port number;
  - The system should start working;
  - Double-click subpatches (objects that look like [pd smth]) to edit the way they react to values received from the application
